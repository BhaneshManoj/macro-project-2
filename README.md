# MACRO PROJECT 2
This project builds on the  understanding of growth theory by introducing key components  of the Solow Growth Model and intertemporal optimization. We  calculate the Solow  residual, calibrate and simulate the Solow model, and solve an optimization problem. The  project emphasizes connecting theoretical models to real-world data.
